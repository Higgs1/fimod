This version is the same as sidke's version, except the "Main" (requirejs) instance is exposed globally as "MainInstance" for maximum cheating- er... debugging! Sure...

factory idle mod

this is a userscript that adds some tweaks to [Factory Idle]

works on both the [Factory Idle] site and [Kongregate]

## configuration

you can toggle each individual setting on fimod's options page in the game

##### improved map navigation
improves dragging, enables map zooming, and allows keyboard movement. use the mouse wheel for zooming, and arrow/wasd keys for keyboard. also fixes the firefox mouse dragging issue

##### fullscreen mode
restructures page content to fit the map in the rest of the remaining space while retaining ads for non-premium users. provides a fullscreen toggle button that works on kongregate as well

##### toggle background mode
prevents the game from automatically entering background mode, and provides a button to manually turn background mode on

##### clear factories
adds a button to the control box that quickly sells all buildings in the current factory

##### show building efficiency
adds a small icon to the corner of buildings that visibly indicates their current efficiency
